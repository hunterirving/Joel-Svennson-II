# Joel-Svennson-II

At the first Iota Omicron Iota Game Jam in September of 2015, Ashlynn Jones and Quentin Hickam created a text-based adventure game starring a parody of beloved Appalachian State CS professor Joel Swanson.

Titled __Joel Svennson__, their game took home first place in a community-choice vote, and was shared and enjoyed by many in the CS department.

At HackNC in October of that year, my brother Josh and I teamed up to create an unofficial fan-sequel to the game, appropriately titled __Joel Svennson II__, which, to our surprise and delight, was officially recognized by Quentin and Ashlynn as canonical to the series.

Joel Svennson II is a love letter to a love letter - a parody of a parody.
We tried to stay close to the source material and lore of the first game, while adding in a few choice anecdotes from time spent in Mr. Swanson's class.

The end result is something that is twice-removed from reality, but I think that's part of the fun of it.

If there were a __Joel Svennson III__, I think it should be a VR game.
